# Spam Email Detection Using Bag of Words

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a **Spam Email Detection** system using the **Bag of Words** model. The goal is to classify emails as either "spam" or "not spam" based on their content.

## Project Overview

The Spam Email Detection system works by converting the text data into a numerical representation using the **Bag of Words** approach. Then, a machine learning algorithm is used to classify the emails based on this representation.

### Features

- **Vectorization**: Using `CountVectorizer` to convert text data into a matrix of token counts.
- **Model Training**: A classification model is trained on the vectorized data to predict whether an email is spam using `MultinomialNB`.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation
